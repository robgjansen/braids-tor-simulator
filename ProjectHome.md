This project aims to provide a high fidelity simulation of the Tor anonymity network and the modifications proposed by the research paper "Recruiting New Tor Relays with BRAIDS". The simulation framework uses discrete-events to simulate the most important parts of Tor that are needed to analyze the performance effects BRAIDS has on the network. Please refer to the Tor and BRAIDS supporting materials for more information.
