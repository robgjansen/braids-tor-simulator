This page contains references to technical design details needed for understanding BRAIDS.

The most important document is the research paper by Rob Jansen, Nicholas Hopper, and Yongdae Kim, "Recruiting New Tor Relays with BRAIDS," presented at CCS 2010.

Other important documents can be found in the references in the BRAIDS paper, and other design documents from the [Tor website](http://www.torproject.org/documentation.html) will aid in understanding how Tor works.

Please see the [BRAIDS documentation in the repository](http://braids-tor-simulator.googlecode.com/svn/trunk/doc/README.txt) for information about the simulator.
